         <h5><em>Chocolate Chip Pancakes are a great way to start the day!</em></h5>
         <p>Pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast pastries to make. They're simple,
            customizable, and delicious all around! Here's what you'll need:

         <h3>~ Ingredients ~</h3>
          <div class="lists">
           <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 Tbs sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup milk <em>(a milk alternative also works)</em></li>

            <li>3 Tbs butter melted</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips <em>(any flavor will do)</em></li>
           </ul>
          </div>
         <h3>~ Instructions ~</h3>
          <div class="lists">
           <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt and sugar until combined.</li>
            <li>In another bowl whisk together milk, egg, butter and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Fold or whisk in your wet ingredients into your dry ingredients until just combined.</li>
            <li>Then fold in your chocolate chips, batter may be lumpy and that is ok.</li>
            <li>Let the batter rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet on stove over medium-high heat and spray with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan in 1/4 cup measurements, gently spread the
                 batter out some then press chocolate chips into the batter.</li>
            <li>Cook on each side for about 3-4 minutes until you see bubbles form and burst 
                on top of batter, and the underside is golden.</li>
            <li>Flip until browned on other side, remove to plate to repeat until all batter is used.</li>
